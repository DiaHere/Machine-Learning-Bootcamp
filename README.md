# Machine-Learning-Bootcamp
Learning and reviewing Machine Learning concepts


ML Pipeline (workflow)
- Data collection
- Cleaning / preprocessing
- Splitting data
- Model training
- Evaluation
- Deployment or interpretation

Supervised Learning (labeled data (inputs + outputs))
- Linear Regression (continuous output)
- Logistic Regression (binary classification)
- Decision Trees & Random Forests
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Gradient Boosting / XGBoost (basic idea)

Unsupervised Learning (data isnâ€™t labeled)
- K-Means Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Model Evaluation & Validation (understand)
- Train/test split
- Cross-validation
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- ROC/AUC
- Overfitting vs. underfitting
